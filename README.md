# FindSurface-RealityKit-visionOS

**Curv*Surf* FindSurfaceâ„¢ demo app for visionOS (Swift)**

## Overview

This demo app demonstrates a basic usage of FindSurface to search vertex points, which ARKit provides as a `MeshAnchor`, for geometry shapes.

## Requirements

This demo app runs on an Apple Vision Pro device only, and requires you permissions to track your hands and to scan your environment (world sensing) to operate as intended.

## How to use

After starting the app, the floating panels (below) will appear on your right side, and you will see wireframe meshes that approximately describe your environments. Performing a spatial tap (pinching with your thumb and index finger) with staring at a location on the meshes will invoke FindSurface, with an indicator (blue disk) appearing on the surface you've gazed.

This panels provide you ways to control the app's behavior and information about geometries you've found. With the panels, you can perform the following actions:

- Touching your right middle finger and thumb together will bring the panel near your hand.
- The button at the top right corner of the Controls window hides or shows the Results window.
- The button at the top right corner of the Results window hides all panels. you can bring them back with the gesture mentioned above.
- Shape icons: In order, they represent plane, sphere, cylinder, cone, and torus. Choose one of these to specify the type of shape to be found using FindSurface.
- You can click the text fields to modify values of the following three parameters.
- `Accuracy` represents the average error of the points in the orthogonal direction to the surface.
- `Avg. Distance` represents the average distance between the points.
- `Touch Radius` specifies the approximate radius of the area of the object to be detected. You can adjust this value by touching the thumb and index finger of both hands together and moving your hands apart or closer.
- `Show inlier points` visualizes the set of points that contribute to the detection of the shape.
- `Show geometry outline` enhances the visibility of the shape by highlighting its outline.
- `Clear Scene` removes all detected shapes.
